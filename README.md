# React Boilerplate

This is a work in progress! If you stumbled upon this repo, take into consideration it is not ready yet.

[Demo](https://react-nodejs-boilerplate-demo.herokuapp.com/) of the boilerplate in action.

This is a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) client, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 server boilerplate of a single codebase project.
Basic functionality is implemented in both server and client.

The server support local authentication using [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/), data storage using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

The React client integrates [redux](http://redux.js.org/) and allows user registration and login against the server.
